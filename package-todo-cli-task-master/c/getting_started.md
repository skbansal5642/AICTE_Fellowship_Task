## Getting started

1. You should have a C compiler available for building the code.

2. You are expected to write the code in `todo.c` file.

3. You should be able to build the app by running `make app`.

4. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\todo.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./todo.sh
   ```
